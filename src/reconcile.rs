//! `reconcile` — the bridge between the pure lifecycle reducer and the durable
//! session ledger, plus the passes that make the two agree.
//!
//! `lifecycle::apply` is the authority on what a legal session tuple is;
//! `db::sessions` is the authority on what survived a restart. This module is
//! the only place that carries a verdict from one into the other:
//!
//! * [`apply_persist`] reduces one event and persists it. Writes happen on
//!   `Applied` only, so a stale or illegal report cannot move the ledger
//!   backwards, and every `Ignored`/`Rejected` is logged with its reason.
//! * the `feed_*` helpers allocate the next version from the stored watermark,
//!   so a scheduler-internal observation (a `swarm_ready` seen on the socket, a
//!   handoff consumed from the out channel) enters the reducer through the same
//!   idempotence gate as a `---swarm-report` frame from the agent.
//! * [`startup_reconcile`] and [`periodic_reconcile`] compare every open session
//!   against the live backend and the task ledger, and record the divergences
//!   that survived a crash into `db::faults`.
//!
//! Two boundaries hold throughout:
//!
//! * `Outcome` belongs to the task ledger. A terminal ledger result is mirrored
//!   through the reducer's authoritative `Heartbeat` snapshot (see [`settle`]),
//!   never by editing projected columns.
//! * an unprovable resource stays unknown. `sched::session_alive`'s rule — a
//!   stub handle, an empty handle, or a probe that failed on transport is
//!   unknown-alive — is reused verbatim, so a dead socket cannot terminate a
//!   session that is still working.
